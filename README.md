# Angular & Angular Material CRUD Client

This is a single-page Angular 6 app designed to consume a simple REST API.

Live Demo: [https://mongodb-angular-app.web.app](https://mongodb-angular-app.web.app)

Visitors have full read/write access, so feel free to play around. Just don't write any bad words or delete all the locations. :)

The front-end is completely decoupled from its back-end counterpart, which can be found here: [https://github.com/jplew/mongodb-firebase-api](https://github.com/jplew/mongodb-firebase-api)
